1. I often doubt my intelligence because I believe enviroments aren't there for me to properly show my intelligence as well as the fact I don't see the need to think when I do not sense I need to.
2. I use logic to process emotion so by that I mean that if it does not make logical sense then I won't feel it or see the need to feel it.
3. I value my family alot
